Reference repo for CompSci 220, Data Structures and Stuff (I can't remember the actual course title or description)

## Projects
Buncha implementations for sorts, ADTs, and more! Most stuff in here is super jank but I love it, like how my parents love me despite me going to a godforsaken military academy.

### Sorts
Hopefully all these algo's will sort my life out. No perm/bogo sort so I'm clinically depressed.

### ADTs
The only thing abstract about these datatypes is the amount of time I spent on them. I honestly need to gather myself before I get a B in a major's class.
